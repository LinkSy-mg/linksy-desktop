# Changelog

Linksy for Linux. Each version's section becomes its release notes.

## 0.1.2

### Fixed
- **Use as Webcam** works in OBS (Video Capture Device (PipeWire)) and other apps that pick
  a camera's format: the camera is offered as YUY2 at 30 fps.
- The Flatpak starts its background service by itself, and at every login.

### Changed
- The app ID is now `mg.diary.linksy.Linksy`. Installing over an older tarball install
  cleans up the old menu entry.

## 0.1.1

### Added
- **Packages**: Linksy now comes as a Flatpak, a .deb (Ubuntu, Debian) and an .rpm
  (Fedora), besides the tarball.
- **Camera preview** right in the app: click Preview on a device's camera card.

### Changed
- Screen windows fit the shape of the shared screen, phones included, with no black bars.
- When the other device can't do something yet, Linksy says so, instead of "declined".

### Fixed
- Quitting never hangs on a device that went quiet.

## 0.1.0

First release of Linksy for Linux: share between your own devices, directly over your
local network, with no account, cloud or server.

### Added
- **Devices**: computers nearby show up on their own; pair once by scanning a QR code,
  entering an address, or comparing a 6-digit code on both screens.
- **Device pages**: send files and folders (or drop them anywhere in the window), send
  your clipboard, ping, and see everything shared with each device as a timeline.
- **Files** arrive with your OK (or automatically from your devices, if you choose),
  resume if interrupted, are checked byte for byte, and open or drag out from the
  timeline. "Send with Linksy" is in the Files right-click menu.
- **View Screen**: watch another computer's screen live; **Take Control** to use its
  mouse and keyboard. The other side always says yes first.
- **Use as Second Display**: extend your desktop onto another device's screen.
- **Use as Webcam**: another device's camera becomes "Linksy Camera" in your apps.
- **Battery friendly**: devices connect only when there's something to share.
- **Lightweight**: the background service uses about 7 MB of memory when idle.
